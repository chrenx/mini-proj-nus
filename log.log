Multimodal Single-Cell Integration Across Time, Individuals, and Batches


Goal:
predict how DNA, RNA, & protein measurements co-vary in single cells

Pearson correlation coefficient to rank submissions

Multiome data set:
    given chromatin accessibility, predict gene expression.
    the correlation between the ground-truth gene expressions and the predicted gene expressions

CITEseq data set:
    given gene expression, predict protein levels.
    the correlation between ground-truth surface protein levels and predicted surface protein levels

The overall score is the average of each sample's correlation score


metadata:
    metadata shape:  (281528, 5)
    281528 unique cell: 
    5 unique day: [ 2  3  4  7 10]
    4 unique donors: [27678 32606 13176 31800]
    8 unique cell_type: ['HSC' 'EryP' 'NeuP' 'MasP' 'MkP' 'BP' 'MoP' 'hidden']
    2 unique technology: ['citeseq' 'multiome']
    The metadata table has no missing values.

    Insight:
        Every cell is used only on a single day and then discarded.
        There are no time series over single cells.
        The two technologies do not share cells. 
        It looks like we may create two completely independent models, one per technology, even if they share the same four donors. It's two Kaggle competitions in one!
        As the models are independent, it is a good idea to work with two separate notebooks, one for CITEseq, the other one for Multiome.
        Donor and cell_type are categorical features, which can be one-hot encoded.
